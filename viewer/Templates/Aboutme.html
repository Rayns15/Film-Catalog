    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Experienced Oracle DevOps Engineer | Driving Efficient Software Delivery & Expanding Full-Stack Capabilities</h2>
    <p>
        With over 10 years of experience as an Oracle DevOps Engineer in an international IT company, I have honed my skills in managing databases, working extensively with SQL, and providing exceptional customer support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Completed two intensive live online training programs totaling over 460 hours, focused on DevOps Engineering and Python Full-Stack Development. The DevOps Engineer Course at IT School (180+ hours over one year) strengthened my expertise in automation and cloud infrastructure, with hands-on experience in AWS, Microsoft Azure, Linux, Git/GitHub, Python, Shell/Bash scripting, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform. I successfully delivered a fully functional CI/CD pipeline and earned a 9/10 on both the theoretical exam and final project.
    </p>
    <p>
        In parallel, I participated in a 280-hour Python Full-Stack Development course at Software Development Academy, deepening my skills in Python (basic to advanced), OOP, algorithms, data structures, back-end development (Flask and Django), testing (pytest), version control (Git), MySQL databases, and front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. These programs complement my current role, where I ensure the availability and stability of productive environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        By embracing DevOps principles and developing robust full-stack skills, I aim to bridge the gap between development and operations, contribute to efficient software delivery, and build innovative web applications. My optimism and proactive approach have always fostered a positive work environment and motivated others. I am excited to leverage my expanded skill set to explore new job opportunities, earn valuable certifications, and contribute to impactful projects.
